The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it sometimes produces unexpected results due to operator precedence or type coercion. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly set. Another issue can be using `calc()` with units that can't be combined or incorrectly using spaces around operators.
